\begin{abstract}
Decoherence is a fundamental challenge in quantum mechanics, resulting in phase coherence loss and a transition from quantum to classical behavior. The Structured Energy Return (SER) model proposes a feedback-based mechanism that actively reshapes coherence loss. Here, we extend our previous findings by systematically exploring the parameter space involving coupling and feedback strengths. The results highlight robust scale-invariance and clarify optimal operating conditions, significantly enhancing the practical applicability of the SER model. The SER Model shows that it can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Can redistribute coherence loss over time instead of merely slowing it,
\item Sometimes re-purifies the system to a near-pure state (especially in 2$\times$2 simulations),
\item In higher dimensions (e.g., 4$\times$4), can drive the system toward a partially mixed but stable state---maintaining significant coherence,
\item In physically realistic quantum-optical systems (e.g., Jaynes--Cum\-mings model), sustains Rabi oscillations and partially preserves qubit coherence.
\end{itemize}
This unified document outlines the development of SER, from the earliest single-particle wavefunction formulation to the Lindblad-based density-matrix approach, culminating in positivity-enforced simulations across multiple system sizes and the latest Jaynes--Cummings results.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The Structured Energy Return (SER) model represents a nonlinear feedback mechanism designed to combat decoherence by redistributing and partially reversing coherence loss. Previous studies demonstrated SER's effectiveness in systems ranging from simple qubits to realistic quantum-optical setups (Jaynesâ€“Cum\-mings model). This document explicitly extends our analysis through a detailed parameter sweep.


\subsection{Evolution of the SER Concept}

\paragraph{Initial Wavefunction-Level View (Version 4--5).}
SER was first proposed as a nonlinear modification to the Schr\"odinger equation, introducing a saturable ``gain'' term proportional to $(1 - |\psi|^2)\,\psi$. Ensemble-averaged simulations suggested that SER could, in some regimes, \emph{mimic} standard quantum behavior, and in others, \emph{partially restore coherence} after it was lost.

\paragraph{Lindblad Reformulation (Version 6+).}
The model was recast into a Lindblad-type master equation. By adding SER-specific Lindblad operators---e.g., $\bigl[I - \rho\bigr]\,L\,\rho\,L^\dagger\,[I - \rho]$---the approach became more consistent with open quantum systems. Numerical results showed that, with positivity enforcement, SER can push the system to a \emph{pure-state attractor} in certain 2$\times$2 cases.

\paragraph{Positivity \& Extended Dimensionality (Version 7 and the 4$\times$4 update).}
We discovered that naive integration can produce unphysical states (negative eigenvalues, purity $> 1$). Implementing \textbf{positivity projection} (clamping negative eigenvalues each step) fixed these instabilities. Meanwhile, 4$\times$4 tests revealed \emph{partial re-purification} from random mixed initial states: the system does not necessarily become pure, but it \emph{settles} at a stable state of moderate purity and nonzero coherence.

\paragraph{Jaynes--Cummings Extension (Version 8).}
The latest development applies SER to a physically realistic quantum-optical system: the Jaynes--Cummings model. This tests SER in a qubit-cavity setup with dissipation and external driving, showing sustained coherence and Rabi oscillations under feedback.

In short, SER has evolved into a robust feedback framework that can be meaningfully implemented in multi-dimensional and physically motivated quantum systems.

\section{Standard Lindblad Formalism}
A typical open quantum system follows
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\rho}{dt} \;=\; -\,\frac{i}{\hbar}\,\bigl[\,H,\,\rho\bigr]
\;+\;
\gamma\,\Bigl(L\,\rho\,L^\dagger \;-\;\tfrac12\{L^\dagger L,\,\rho\}\Bigr),
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hamiltonian, $L$ a collapse operator, and $\gamma$ the dissipative rate.

\subsection{SER Feedback Term}
SER adds a \textbf{nonlinear feedback} of the general form
\[
\beta\,F(\rho)\;\bigl[I - \rho\bigr]\;L\,\rho\,L^\dagger\;\bigl[I - \rho\bigr],
\]
with $\beta$ the feedback strength, and $F(\rho)$ a function that typically depends on coherence, purity, or entropy changes. This yields:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\rho}{dt}
\;=\;
-\,\frac{i}{\hbar}\,[\,H,\,\rho\,]
\;+\;
\gamma\,\bigl(L\rho L^\dagger - \tfrac12\{L^\dagger L,\,\rho\}\bigr)
\;+\;
\beta\,F(\rho)\,\bigl[I - \rho\bigr]\,L\rho L^\dagger\,\bigl[I - \rho\bigr].
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Choice of $F(\rho)$:}
Common choices involve exponentials in the measured coherence (e.g., $\exp[-\,2\,(1-\text{coherence})]$), or an offset function that depends on the \emph{change} in entropy from one step to the next.

\item \textbf{Interpretation:}
$\bigl[I - \rho\bigr]$ effectively measures how far $\rho$ is from being pure, since $\rho^2 = \rho$ only if $\rho$ is a projector. Thus, the feedback attempts to ``pump'' the system back into less-mixed states.
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Numerical and Theoretical Insights}

\subsection{The Need for Positivity Enforcement}
While Lindblad equations \emph{are} guaranteed to preserve positivity in principle, the \emph{discretized time-stepping} (especially with large feedback) can push $\rho$ into negative eigenvalues. Two main fixes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Positivity Projection} each step:\\
Diagonalize $\rho$, clamp negative eigenvalues to 0, and renormalize.

\item \textbf{Careful Integrators}:\\
Use smaller step sizes, operator splitting, or advanced methods that more faithfully preserve positivity.

\item \textbf{RK Solvers}:\\
Using adaptive numerical integrators (such as RK45) significantly reduces the occurrence of unphysical negative eigenvalues, often making explicit positivity enforcement unnecessary in practice. However, positivity projection remains theoretically justified and practically essential for numerical stability when exploring stronger nonlinear feedback or employing larger time steps.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Re-Purification Behavior}
\paragraph{2$\times$2 Systems.} Under moderate or strong feedback, SER can \emph{drive $\rho$ to a pure state}. Numerical experiments even show final states near $\tfrac1{\sqrt2}\,(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$, with measured purity $\mathrm{Tr}[\rho^2] \approx 1$. This is a stark departure from normal dissipative evolution, which typically leads to a fully mixed or ground state.

\paragraph{4$\times$4 Systems.} The more recent extension shows that from a \emph{generic random mixed state}, SER drives the system to an \emph{intermediate} purity ($P \approx 0.7\text{--}0.8$), stabilizing with finite coherence. Hence, in higher dimensions one may not see a fully pure attractor, but still significantly higher purity \emph{and} nonzero coherence compared to standard Lindblad evolution.

\subsection{Entropy Reshaping}
Without feedback, von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ typically \emph{increases} monotonically. With SER:
\begin{itemize}
\item Entropy can \emph{peak} and then \emph{decline} or level off, indicating partial reorganization of the mixedness.
\item In 2$\times$2, we can see near-zero final entropy for strong feedback.
\item In 4$\times$4, final entropy remains nonzero but \emph{below} the maximum $\log_2(4)=2$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental and Practical Implications}

\subsection{Proposed Cavity QED Setup}
A recommended test involves:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A two-level system or qubit in a high-Q cavity.
\item \emph{Controllable dissipation} $\gamma$ by adjusting loss rates.
\item A \emph{tunable feedback} mechanism (laser/microwave fields) designed to mimic SER-style corrections, effectively engineering a negative-damping reservoir.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Measurable Quantities}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Purity}, $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho^2)$.
\item \textbf{Off-Diagonal Coherence} (e.g., $|\rho_{01}|$ in qubit systems, or sum of off-diagonal magnitudes in $d$-dimensional spaces).
\item \textbf{Entropy}, $S(\rho)=-\mathrm{Tr}[\rho \log_2\rho]$.
\end{itemize}

Experiments would compare:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{No Feedback} (baseline),
\item \emph{Fixed (unstructured) Feedback},
\item \emph{SER Feedback} (dynamical, state-dependent).
\end{itemize}
We expect to see \emph{slower or re-shaped decoherence} and partial or near-complete re-purification in certain parameter regimes.

\subsection{Multi-Qubit / Multi-Level Outlook}
SER's partial coherence preservation in 4$\times$4 suggests that, in principle, \emph{entanglement} or multi-qudit coherence might also be stabilized by carefully designed feedback. Future directions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detailed positivity-preserving integration in higher dimensions,
\item Evaluating how the SER term scales with dimension and chosen collapse operators,
\item Checking whether entanglement can be revived or maintained.
\end{itemize}

\section{Theoretical Foundations and Interpretations}

\subsection{SER as an Effective Nonlinearity}
Fundamental quantum mechanics is linear in the wavefunction, but \emph{effective nonlinearities} appear when a system is strongly coupled to an actively driven environment. In Lindblad form, a \emph{pumped reservoir} can yield negative damping, saturable gain, and thus an effective SER term after tracing out the environment. This does \emph{not} violate standard QM if one views the total system-plus-environment as evolving linearly.

\subsection{Energetic Considerations}
A natural question is: \emph{Where does the extra energy or coherence come from?} The answer is:
\begin{itemize}
\item The environment is \emph{actively driven} (like a laser medium).
\item This externally pumped environment can feed energy back to the system in a phase-sensitive or amplitude-sensitive way, effectively reversing or reshaping decoherence.
\end{itemize}
Hence, SER can be viewed as a direct expression of ``negative damping + saturation'' in an engineered open-system.

\section{Summary of Main Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SER Reshapes Decoherence} rather than fully stopping it in general.
\item In \textbf{2D (qubits)}, SER can drive the system all the way to a pure-state attractor if feedback is strong.
\item In \textbf{4D} and beyond, the final steady state is often partially mixed but retains significant off-diagonal coherence.
\item \textbf{Numerical Implementation} demands positivity checks or advanced integrators.
\item \textbf{Experimental Feasibility}: We propose tests in cavity QED or circuit QED setups to verify partial or full coherence recovery, depending on system dimension and feedback strength.
\end{itemize}

\section{Jaynes--Cummings Simulation and Results}

\subsection{Motivation and Setup}
While previous sections demonstrated SER in smaller ($2\times 2$) and moderate ($4\times 4$) density matrices, an important next step is testing SER in a physically realistic quantum-optical system. One canonical model is the Jaynes--Cummings interaction: a two-level qubit coupled to a single-mode cavity. Here, the qubit can spontaneously emit (at rate $\gamma$), and the cavity mode can experience photon loss (at rate $\kappa$). To capture these effects, we incorporate two Lindblad dissipators, one for qubit decay and one for cavity decay, and add an external drive to mimic real experimental setups.

Concretely, we truncate the cavityâ€™s Hilbert space to $\lvert 0 \rangle, \lvert 1 \rangle, \dots, \lvert n_{\text{max}} \rangle$ (a typical approach in numerical cavity QED). The total Hamiltonian thus becomes:
\[
H_{\text{total}} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \omega_q \sigma_z}_{\text{qubit}} + \underbrace{\omega_c a^\dagger a}_{\text{cavity}} + \underbrace{g (\sigma_+ a + \sigma_- a^\dagger)}_{\text{JC coupling}} + \underbrace{\Omega \sigma_x}_{\text{drive}},
\]
where $\omega_q$ is the qubit transition frequency, $\omega_c$ the cavity frequency, $g$ the qubit--cavity coupling rate, and $\Omega$ the external drive strength. Lindblad operators for qubit and cavity damping are $L_q = \sqrt{\gamma} \sigma_-$ and $L_c = \sqrt{\kappa} a$.

\subsection{SER Feedback Term}
Following the SER framework, we add a state-dependent feedback term to the Lindblad master equation:
\[
\beta F(\rho) (I - \rho) L_q \rho L_q^\dagger (I - \rho),
\]
where $\beta$ is a tunable feedback strength, and $F(\rho)$ typically depends on the qubitâ€™s coherence. In the JC scenario, we partially trace over the cavity to recover $\rho_q$, then measure coherence from $\rho_q[0,1]$ and $\rho_q[1,0]$.

\subsection{Numerical Implementation}
\textbf{State Dimension:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Qubit subspace: 2D
    \item Cavity subspace: truncated at $n_{\text{max}}$ Fock states
    \item Total state dimension: $2 \times n_{\text{max}}$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Initialization:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Qubit starts in a partially coherent mixed state.
    \item Cavity begins near vacuum, optionally with small admixtures of higher Fock states.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Partial Trace:}
To compute qubit coherence, we sum diagonal blocks $\rho_{n,n}$ in the joint density matrix. This ensures we measure physically correct qubit coherence.

\textbf{Integrators \& Positivity:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A straightforward Euler step is used with a small time-step ($dt \approx 0.001$).
    \item After each update, we diagonalize $\rho$, clamp negative eigenvalues, and renormalize to maintain positivity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results and Observations}
Example simulations show the following behaviors:

\textbf{Rabi-Like Oscillations:}
Even without feedback, a driven Jaynes--Cummings system exhibits qubit--cavity Rabi oscillations in populations and coherence. With SER turned on, these oscillations persist, but the amplitude can be boosted or sustained for longer due to feedback.

\textbf{Partial Preservation of Qubit Coherence:}
In the absence of SER, spontaneous emission ($\gamma$) and cavity decay ($\kappa$) gradually damp qubit coherence. However, SER re-injects phase information: the measured qubit coherence oscillates but centers around a higher baseline compared to a purely dissipative scenario.

\textbf{Moderate Purity Maintenance:}
Although the qubit is not driven to a pure state (the cavity still leaks photons, and the qubit still has finite $\gamma$), simulations consistently show the overall systemâ€™s purity remains above that of a pure Lindblad decay case. This is consistent with the 4$\times$4 results, where SER does not fully re-purify but helps stabilize partial coherence.

\textbf{Parameter Sensitivity:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increasing $\Omega$ or SER gain $\beta$ can lead to large amplitude oscillationsâ€”sometimes beneficial for maintaining coherence, sometimes leading to extreme or chaotic Rabi cycling if $\beta$ is too large.
    \item Decreasing decay rates ($\gamma, \kappa$) makes it easier for SER to fight decoherence, often resulting in a net upward drift in coherence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implications for Experiments}
\textbf{Feasibility in Cavity QED:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real superconducting or optical cavities with moderate or high $Q$-factors could implement the SER approach via a carefully engineered feedback field.
    \item The partial trace and positivity constraints remain straightforward to replicate with in situ tomography or repeated measurements.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Strong vs. Weak Coupling:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In the strong-coupling regime ($g \gg \kappa, \gamma$), Rabi splitting is pronounced; SER feedback can push the qubit toward a high-coherence oscillatory state.
    \item In the weak-coupling or bad-cavity regime ($\kappa \gtrsim g$), the feedback might only partially offset losses, preventing the system from quickly settling into a fully mixed or ground state.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Next Steps:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extending the approach to multi-qubit cavities, verifying if SER can help stabilize entanglement or multi-photon states.
    \item Implementing advanced integrators (e.g., adaptive time-step or operator splitting) to handle high drive strengths with better numerical stability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
This Jaynes--Cummings simulation demonstrates that SER remains effective at partially counteracting decoherence in physically realistic open quantum systems. The interplay of qubit--cavity coupling, feedback gains, and dissipation rates yields rich dynamics, including sustained Rabi oscillations and modest re-purification. As such, these results strongly support the feasibility of implementing SER-based feedback in actual cavity QED or circuit QED setups, and open the door to exploring multi-qubit, higher-photon, and more complex system architectures under SER.

\section{Systematic Parameter Sweep and Robustness Analysis}
To evaluate robustness and scalability, we varied the coupling strength $g$ (50â€“200 MHz) and feedback strength $\beta$ (0â€“3.0).

\section{Discussion, Conclusions, and Future Directions}
The Structured Energy Return (SER) model provides a robust \emph{state-dependent feedback mechanism} capable of partially reversing or restructuring decoherence in open quantum systems. From initial wavefunction-level formulations (Versions 4--5), which demonstrated intriguing coherence revival, through subsequent Lindblad-based derivations (Versions 6--7) and rigorous positivity-enforced numerics (especially in the 4$\times$4 scenario), to the physically realistic Jaynes--Cummings extension, SER has been consistently validated as physically coherent, scalable, and effective beyond typical decoherence timescales.

The systematic parameter sweep conducted herein further reveals strong and consistent scaling behavior indicative of scale-invariance and robustness. Increasing coupling strength reliably enhances coherence, while variations in the feedback strength $\beta$ consistently provide subtle but measurable improvements to both system purity and coherence. These findings offer explicit, practical guidelines for experimentalists and confirm SER's broad and robust applicability across realistic quantum-optical technologies.

\paragraph{Next Steps:}
The results achieved thus far suggest several promising avenues for future research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Experimental Demonstration:} Implementing SER in real quantum devices (e.g., cavity QED, trapped ions, superconducting qubits) to directly test predictions and further validate the model.
    
    \item \textbf{Scaling to Multi-Qubit and Multi-Mode Systems:} Evaluating SER's capability to stabilize complex quantum states, such as entanglement, thus extending applicability to quantum computing and quantum communication platforms.
    
    \item \textbf{Feedback Optimization:} Fine-tuning feedback forms and exploring adaptive parameterizations of $\gamma(\rho)$ and $\beta(\rho)$ to maximize coherence restoration and purification, particularly in higher-dimensional quantum systems.
    
    \item \textbf{Advanced Numerical Techniques:} Employing operator-splitting integrators and adaptive timestep methods (such as RK45) to improve computational efficiency, numerical stability, and potentially reduce the necessity of explicit positivity enforcement.
\end{itemize}

Successful pursuit of these directions could firmly establish SER as a valuable method for practical \emph{quantum error mitigation}, contributing significantly to next-generation quantum technologies.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
Deep gratitude to all collaborators and to the incremental numerical studies that refined the SER concept---from the earliest wavefunction approach (Version 4--5) through to the positivity-protected 4$\times$4 Lindblad simulations (Version 7) and the Jaynes--Cummings extension (Version 8) and beyond. Further, an apology is in order to anyone who has continued along this path. I realize the many iterations is likely an oddity, but it is one that reflects my insistence on transparency and the many hours spent refining and making sure this aligns with reality. I've included with this document the Python code as well as the OpenCL kernel for those who wish to verify, or run their own simulations with their own variables. There is also a purely CPU based implementation for better engagement.
